 # TDD ( Testing Driven development)
### Cycle :
1. Add a test
2. Run all tests. The new test should fail for expected reasons
3. Write the simplest code that passes the new test
4. All tests should now pass
5. Refactor as needed, using tests after each refactor to ensure that functionality is preserved

### Repeat
  * The cycle above is repeated for each new piece of functionality.
  * Tests should be small and incremental, and commits made often.
